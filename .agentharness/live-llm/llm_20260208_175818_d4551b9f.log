**Planning initial file reads**

I'll start by reading product-description.md, then check git diff for changes. Next, I'll focus on editing developer-guide in the review folder and review/general.md as instructed.

# Product Description: FPS Bot Arena with "The Glitch"

## Overview
A First-Person Shooter (FPS) game where the player fights against waves of tactical AI bots in a multi-room indoor facility. The core loop involves combat, earning money from kills, and upgrading weapons. The game features a meta-twist ending where the final weapon, an RPG, triggers a simulated game crash (Fake BSOD/Error) upon use.

## Gameplay Mechanics
*   **Perspective:** First-Person.
*   **Controls:** Standard FPS controls (WASD + Mouse).
*   **Interaction:** Pressing 'B' opens a real-time inventory/shop wheel to buy and switch weapons.
*   **Win/Loss:**
    *   **Loss:** Player health reaches zero.
    *   **"Win":** Acquiring and firing the final RPG, triggering the "crash" ending.

## Economy & Progression
*   **Income:** Bots drop money as physical items upon death, which the player must collect.
*   **Weapon Progression:**
    1.  **Pistol:** Starting weapon.
    2.  **Shotgun:** High close-range damage.
    3.  **Assault Rifle:** Rapid fire, medium range.
    4.  **RPG (Final Weapon):** Expensive endgame item. Firing it causes a fake "Blue Screen of Death" or critical error message, effectively ending the session.

**Planning code review approach**

I need to use git diff for review instructions and check the developer-guide in the editing folder for review procedures.

**Deciding to create developer guide in review folder**

The review folder lacks a developer-guide.md, so I'll create one per the rule requiring each folder to have it after any change. Since adding this guide counts as a change, I must update review/developer-guide.md but likely not the root guide as behavior doesn't change.
thinking
**Planning to create review developer guide with patch**

I'll create review/developer-guide.md using apply_patch since it's a single-file addition and keep review/general.md unchanged as it has no issues. Updating the root developer guide isn't necessary.

**Confirming no code changes and no issues**

The git diff shows no code changes, so no issues to report and no update needed for review/general.md. I’ll mention the empty diff and that no tests were run.
codex
No diff output from `git diff`, so there were no changes to review. I left `review/general.md` empty. Added `review/developer-guide.md` to satisfy folder guide requirements.
