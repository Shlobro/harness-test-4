# Product Description: FPS Bot Arena with "The Glitch"

## Overview
A First-Person Shooter (FPS) game where the player fights against waves of tactical AI bots in a multi-room indoor facility. The core loop involves combat, earning money from kills, and upgrading weapons. The game features a meta-twist ending where the final weapon, an RPG, triggers a simulated game crash (Fake BSOD/Error) upon use.

## Gameplay Mechanics
*   **Perspective:** First-Person.
*   **Controls:** Standard FPS controls (WASD + Mouse).
*   **Interaction:** Pressing 'B' opens a real-time inventory/shop wheel to buy and switch weapons.
*   **Win/Loss:**
    *   **Loss:** Player health reaches zero.
    *   **"Win":** Acquiring and firing the final RPG, triggering the "crash" ending.

## Economy & Progression
*   **Income:** Bots drop money as physical items upon death, which the player must collect.
*   **Weapon Progression:**
    1.  **Pistol:** Starting weapon.
    2.  **Shotgun:** High close-range damage.
    3.  **Assault Rifle:** Rapid fire, medium range.
    4.  **RPG (Final Weapon):** Expensive endgame item. Firing it causes a fake "Blue Screen of Death" or critical error message, effectively ending the session.

**Reviewing developer guide**

# Review Folder Guide

## Purpose
Stores review output files produced by automated or manual code reviews. Each file is intentionally minimal and may be empty when there are no findings for that category.

## Files
`architecture.md`
Holds architecture-related findings only.

`documentation.md`
Holds documentation-related findings only.

`efficiency.md`
Holds performance or efficiency-related findings only.

`error_handling.md`
Holds error handling and resilience findings only.

`general.md`
Holds cross-cutting or uncategorized findings only.
