**Planning to review and update docs**

I'm gathering instructions to read product-description.md, find and review developer guides, check changes with git diff, and update review/ui_ux.md accordingly, ensuring developer-guide.md is reviewed and updated in the edited review folder and its ancestors.

# Product Description: FPS Bot Arena with "The Glitch"

## Overview
A First-Person Shooter (FPS) game where the player fights against waves of tactical AI bots in a multi-room indoor facility. The core loop involves combat, earning money from kills, and upgrading weapons. The game features a meta-twist ending where the final weapon, an RPG, triggers a simulated game crash (Fake BSOD/Error) upon use.

## Gameplay Mechanics
*   **Perspective:** First-Person.
*   **Controls:** Standard FPS controls (WASD + Mouse).
*   **Interaction:** Pressing 'B' opens a real-time inventory/shop wheel to buy and switch weapons.
*   **Win/Loss:**
    *   **Loss:** Player health reaches zero.
    *   **"Win":** Acquiring and firing the final RPG, triggering the "crash" ending.

## Economy & Progression
*   **Income:** Bots drop money as physical items upon death, which the player must collect.
*   **Weapon Progression:**
    1.  **Pistol:** Starting weapon.
    2.  **Shotgun:** High close-range damage.
    3.  **Assault Rifle:** Rapid fire, medium range.
    4.  **RPG (Final Weapon):** Expensive endgame item. Firing it causes a fake "Blue Screen of Death" or critical error message, effectively ending the session.

# Review Folder Guide

## Purpose
Stores review output files produced by automated or manual code reviews. Each file is intentionally minimal and may be empty when there are no findings for that category.
Review files should contain only issue lists (no positive notes).

## Files
`architecture.md`
Holds architecture-related findings only.

`documentation.md`
Holds documentation-related findings only.

`efficiency.md`
Holds performance or efficiency-related findings only.

`error_handling.md`
Holds error handling and resilience findings only.

`general.md`

**Confirming no UI/UX changes**

The diff shows only documentation changes with no source code updates, so no UI/UX issues exist to report; I'll leave the UI/UX review file unchanged and skip unnecessary edits.
