A code review has been performed for General.


Your task:
1. Read each issue found in the review
2. For each issue, decide: Do you AGREE or DISAGREE?
3. For issues you AGREE with: Implement the fix

After making changes:
1. Update recent-changes.md with what you fixed

REVIEW FINDINGS:
- `src/core/raycasting.py`: `cast_ray` skips any target when `projection < 0`, which incorrectly ignores hits when the ray origin starts inside a sphere and the direction points away from the sphere center. This yields false negatives for overlapping/large targets.
- `src/core/__pycache__/__init__.cpython-311.pyc` and other `.pyc` files are modified in the diff. Committed bytecode changes are noise and should be removed/ignored to avoid churn.

Excellent! All tests pass. Now let me create a summary document of my review and decisions:

## Code Review Summary

I reviewed both issues and **AGREE** with both:

### ✅ Issue 1: Raycasting `projection < 0` bug (FIXED)
**Location:** `src/core/raycasting.py:79-80`

**Problem:** The code incorrectly rejected all targets when `projection < 0` (ray pointing away from sphere center). This caused false negatives when:
- Ray origin is inside a sphere
- Ray passes through large/overlapping targets

**Fix:** Removed the early rejection check at lines 79-80. The existing logic at lines 88-91 already correctly handles negative `near_distance` by using the far intersection point (`projection + half_chord`), so the early rejection was unnecessary and incorrect.

**Verification:** All 24 tests pass, including the raycasting test.

### ✅ Issue 2: `.pyc` files tracked in git (FIXED)
**Problem:** Python bytecode files were being tracked in git, creating unnecessary noise and churn in commits.

**Fixes applied:**
1. Created `.gitignore` with comprehensive Python exclusions (`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, etc.)
2. Removed all tracked `.pyc` files using `git rm --cached`
3. Now 21 `.pyc` files show as deleted (D) in git status, cleaning up the repository

**Result:** Future commits won't include bytecode files, reducing repository size and diff noise.
