# Product Description: FPS Bot Arena with "The Glitch"

## Overview
A First-Person Shooter (FPS) game where the player fights against waves of tactical AI bots in a multi-room indoor facility. The core loop involves combat, earning money from kills, and upgrading weapons. The game features a meta-twist ending where the final weapon, an RPG, triggers a simulated game crash (Fake BSOD/Error) upon use.

## Gameplay Mechanics
*   **Perspective:** First-Person.
*   **Controls:** Standard FPS controls (WASD + Mouse).
*   **Interaction:** Pressing 'B' opens a real-time inventory/shop wheel to buy and switch weapons.
*   **Win/Loss:**
    *   **Loss:** Player health reaches zero.
    *   **"Win":** Acquiring and firing the final RPG, triggering the "crash" ending.

## Economy & Progression
*   **Income:** Bots drop money as physical items upon death, which the player must collect.
*   **Weapon Progression:**
    1.  **Pistol:** Starting weapon.
    2.  **Shotgun:** High close-range damage.
    3.  **Assault Rifle:** Rapid fire, medium range.
    4.  **RPG (Final Weapon):** Expensive endgame item. Firing it causes a fake "Blue Screen of Death" or critical error message, effectively ending the session.

# Review Folder Guide

## Purpose
Stores review output files produced by automated or manual code reviews. Each file is intentionally minimal and may be empty when there are no findings for that category.
Review files should contain only issue lists (no positive notes).

## Files
`architecture.md`
Holds architecture-related findings only.

`documentation.md`
Holds documentation-related findings only.

`efficiency.md`
Holds performance or efficiency-related findings only.

`error_handling.md`
Holds error handling and resilience findings only.

**Checking for UI/UX issues in input changes**

The diff didn't include files related to UI changes like the shop wheel, so UI-related impacts seem limited to the input handler toggle logic. The toggle logic uses key edge detection, which likely avoids unintended toggles during paused states, minimizing UI/UX risks there.
thinking
**Verifying potential edge case in input state tracking**

The input tracking uses fresh snapshots each frame, mitigating issues if key releases aren't detected (e.g., on app focus loss), so toggle logic should remain stable. No UI/UX issues found to document, but I plan to create or clear the review/ui_ux.md file as required.
