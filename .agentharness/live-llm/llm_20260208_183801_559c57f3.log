**Reviewing documentation structure**

I'm preparing to read the product-description.md and relevant developer-guide files, especially the editing folder and review/general.md, to understand required changes before proceeding.

# Product Description: FPS Bot Arena with "The Glitch"

## Overview
A First-Person Shooter (FPS) game where the player fights against waves of tactical AI bots in a multi-room indoor facility. The core loop involves combat, earning money from kills, and upgrading weapons. The game features a meta-twist ending where the final weapon, an RPG, triggers a simulated game crash (Fake BSOD/Error) upon use.

## Gameplay Mechanics
*   **Perspective:** First-Person.
*   **Controls:** Standard FPS controls (WASD + Mouse).
*   **Interaction:** Pressing 'B' opens a real-time inventory/shop wheel to buy and switch weapons.
*   **Win/Loss:**
    *   **Loss:** Player health reaches zero.
    *   **"Win":** Acquiring and firing the final RPG, triggering the "crash" ending.

## Economy & Progression
*   **Income:** Bots drop money as physical items upon death, which the player must collect.
*   **Weapon Progression:**
    1.  **Pistol:** Starting weapon.
    2.  **Shotgun:** High close-range damage.
    3.  **Assault Rifle:** Rapid fire, medium range.
    4.  **RPG (Final Weapon):** Expensive endgame item. Firing it causes a fake "Blue Screen of Death" or critical error message, effectively ending the session.

**Planning documentation review**

Planning to write findings to review/general.md and verify existence of review/developer-guide.md, then read developer guide in editing folder before making changes. Next step is to list or search files to confirm paths.

**Reviewing developer guide**

The developer guide provides foundational info likely useful for understanding project conventions and setup, shaping how I proceed with implementation and testing.

# Review Folder Guide

## Purpose
Stores review output files produced by automated or manual code reviews. Each file is intentionally minimal and may be empty when there are no findings for that category.
Review files should contain only issue lists (no positive notes).

## Files
`architecture.md`
Holds architecture-related findings only.

`documentation.md`
Holds documentation-related findings only.

`efficiency.md`
Holds performance or efficiency-related findings only.

`error_handling.md`
Holds error handling and resilience findings only.

`general.md`


thinking
**Confirming no code-related issues in doc-only diff**

The diff includes only documentation and metadata changes with no new or modified code files visible; the docs mention new systems, but those code parts likely preexist and aren’t part of this diff. Since review focuses on recent changes in the diff, no issues are found.
thinking
**Questioning doc accuracy versus missing code**

Docs mention new systems in developer guides and recent changes with no corresponding code in the diff; this raises a potential mismatch, so I'll check if the related code folders exist to judge if the docs might be inaccurate or code is simply unchanged.

**Deciding on review content**

I'll write review/general.md with any found issues, but since only docs and tasks changed and no clear code or process problems emerged, the file will likely stay empty or unchanged.
thinking
**Confirming no issues and no file changes**

No issues were found in the diff, so review/general.md remains empty and unchanged; I'll report this concisely without adding positive remarks.
