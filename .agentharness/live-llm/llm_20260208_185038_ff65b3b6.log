# Product Description: FPS Bot Arena with "The Glitch"

## Overview
A First-Person Shooter (FPS) game where the player fights against waves of tactical AI bots in a multi-room indoor facility. The core loop involves combat, earning money from kills, and upgrading weapons. The game features a meta-twist ending where the final weapon, an RPG, triggers a simulated game crash (Fake BSOD/Error) upon use.

## Gameplay Mechanics
*   **Perspective:** First-Person.
*   **Controls:** Standard FPS controls (WASD + Mouse).
*   **Interaction:** Pressing 'B' opens a real-time inventory/shop wheel to buy and switch weapons.
*   **Win/Loss:**
    *   **Loss:** Player health reaches zero.
    *   **"Win":** Acquiring and firing the final RPG, triggering the "crash" ending.

## Economy & Progression
*   **Income:** Bots drop money as physical items upon death, which the player must collect.
*   **Weapon Progression:**
    1.  **Pistol:** Starting weapon.
    2.  **Shotgun:** High close-range damage.
    3.  **Assault Rifle:** Rapid fire, medium range.
    4.  **RPG (Final Weapon):** Expensive endgame item. Firing it causes a fake "Blue Screen of Death" or critical error message, effectively ending the session.

**Scoping coherent task set**

I found that environment behavior is partially present but still unchecked, and HUD is entirely missing, so I’ll target those incomplete tasks plus economy price balancing. Next I’m reading `src/environment`, `src/economy`, and test patterns to implement these cleanly with coverage.

# Economy Developer Guide

## Purpose
`src/economy/` models world money drops, pickup visuals, collision checks, and player collection.

## Files
- `money.py`: money pickup entity, visual definitions, spawn/update lifecycle, and collection system.
- `__init__.py`: package exports for economy modules.

## Key Behaviors
- `MoneyPickupSystem.spawn_pickup(...)` creates uniquely identified pickups with primitive visual definitions.
- `MoneyPickup.intersects_sphere(...)` handles pickup collision checks against player pickup radius.
- `MoneyPickupSystem.collect_for_player(...)` transfers money to the player when collisions occur and removes collected pickups.
- `MoneyPickup.step(...)` supports TTL expiration; expired pickups are removed during `MoneyPickupSystem.step(...)`.
- `get_money_pickup_visual(amount)` returns a glowing cube for smaller amounts and glowing sphere for larger drops.

# Environment Developer Guide

## Purpose
`src/environment/` defines the indoor facility layout and turns that layout into reusable collision and navigation data.

## Files
- `facility.py`: dataclasses for rooms, doorways, cover objects, spawn points, and lighting; includes `create_default_facility_layout()` with a 5-room tactical facility.
- `collision.py`: converts room boundaries + doorway openings + blocking cover into a `CollisionWorld` for player and projectile collision.
- `navigation.py`: validates layout waypoint links and creates a `WaypointPathfinder`.
- `__init__.py`: package exports for facility, collision, and navigation helpers.

## Layout Contents
- Five distinct rooms: `lobby`, `central_hall`, `storage`, `lab`, and `security`.
- Doorway connectivity between rooms via explicit `Doorway` records.
- Distributed cover objects (`crate`, `pillar`, `barrier`) represented as AABB prisms.
- Waypoint graph and links for AI route planning.
- Spawn point records for player and bots.
- Engine-agnostic ambient + directional lighting profile.

**Planning HUD and config tasks**
codex
I confirmed environment tasks are already implemented in code, so I’ll avoid “paper-completing” those and instead complete unimplemented items with real code: HUD system plus weapon price balancing. I’m now reading the relevant folder guides (`src`, `config`, `tests`) before editing.

# Tests Developer Guide

## Overview
This directory contains the automated test suite for the FPS Bot Arena project.

## Testing Framework
- **Framework:** `pytest`
- **Rationale:** Standard, powerful, and easy-to-use testing framework for Python.

## Structure
- Test files should be named `test_<module_name>.py`.
- Tests should mirror the structure of the `src/` and `config/` directories where applicable.
- `conftest.py` inserts the repository root into `sys.path` so package-style imports (`src.*`, `config.*`) work in pytest.

## Current Test Modules
- `test_config.py`: validates immutable config defaults.
- `test_core_systems.py`: validates game clock timing controls, raycasting behavior, state transitions, input handling, and loop update dispatch behavior.
- `test_player_and_weapons.py`: validates player health/economy/inventory/shooting and weapon cooldown/ammo behavior.
- `test_advanced_combat_and_movement.py`: validates camera look, movement collision/slide, smooth weapon switching transitions, hit-scan shooting, weapon visuals, weapon behaviors, and projectile collisions.
- `test_shop_ui.py`: validates shop wheel radial layout, `B`-toggle input behavior, pause/state synchronization while shopping, pricing visibility, affordability feedback, purchase validation, and owned-weapon selection/equip behavior.
 succeeded in 228ms:
# Src Developer Guide

## Purpose
`src/` contains the game runtime modules for loop/state management, player logic, weapons, and projectile simulation.

## Folder Overview
- `core/`: frame stepping, game clock (pause + time scale), state machine, input normalization, first-person camera state, movement, collision primitives, and raycasting.
- `player/`: player runtime model (health, money, inventory, immediate + smooth weapon switching, reload, hit-scan/projectile shooting, game-over/respawn).
- `weapons/`: reusable weapon abstractions, concrete weapons (pistol/shotgun/assault rifle/RPG), switch-transition state, and primitive visual definitions.
- `projectiles/`: projectile entities plus physics stepping and world collision checks.
- `ui/`: shop wheel catalog, radial layout generation, affordability/equipped status projection, and open/close interaction controller.
- `ai/`: bot runtime model, shot-accuracy helpers, tactical decision/cover/flank planners, and wave spawning+difficulty scaling.
- `economy/`: money pickup entities, glowing primitive visual definitions, pickup lifecycle, and player collection logic.
- `environment/`: multi-room facility definitions, doorway connectivity, cover placements, collision world generation, and nav graph generation.

## Integration Flow
1. The platform layer collects raw input and passes it to `core.input_handler.InputHandler`.
2. Mouse look deltas update `core.camera.FirstPersonCamera`; resulting yaw drives movement direction.
3. `core.movement.PlayerMovementController` computes collision-aware movement against `core.collision.CollisionWorld`.
4. The game loop (`core.game_loop.GameLoop`) advances time using `core.game_clock.GameClock`.
 succeeded in 228ms:
# Developer Guide

## Purpose
`config/` contains centralized, importable configuration for gameplay and economy values.

## Files
- `config.py`: frozen dataclass-based configuration models and exported singleton config objects.

## How To Use
- Import `GAME_CONFIG` for core player/runtime constants.
- Import `ECONOMY_CONFIG` for weapon price progression values.
- Prefer updating values here rather than scattering literals across systems.

**Planning HUD module creation**
codex
I’m proceeding with 9 incomplete tasks: HUD overlay + health bar + ammo + money + crosshair + damage indicator + kill counter + `src/hud/developer-guide.md`, plus economy price balancing. I’ll implement code and tests first, then update `tasks.md`, `recent-changes.md`, and ancestor guides.

I’ve rebalanced the price curve and updated shop tests. I’m now checking for any other tests/docs that still reference the old values, then I’ll run the full suite and finish required markdown updates.

# UI Developer Guide

## Purpose
`src/ui/` contains non-rendering UI logic for the in-game shop wheel.

## Files
- `shop_wheel.py`: radial shop layout, catalog definitions, open/close state control, pause synchronization, and purchase/equip interactions.
- `__init__.py`: package exports for shop wheel types and helpers.

## Core Concepts
- `ShopCatalogItem` defines a weapon listing with `weapon_name`, `price`, and a weapon factory.
- `default_shop_catalog()` provides progression store inventory:
  - Shotgun (`300`)
  - AssaultRifle (`900`)
  - RPG (`2500`)
- `ShopWheelLayout.build_entries(...)` converts catalog items into render-ready `ShopWheelEntry` objects with:
  - radial slot position (`angle_degrees`, `anchor_x`, `anchor_y`)
  - ownership state (`is_owned`)
  - equipped state (`is_equipped`)
  - affordability state (`can_afford`, `is_affordable_to_buy`)

 ## Core Concepts
 - `ShopCatalogItem` defines a weapon listing with `weapon_name`, `price`, and a weapon factory.
 - `default_shop_catalog()` provides progression store inventory:
-  - Shotgun (`300`)
-  - AssaultRifle (`900`)
-  - RPG (`2500`)
+  - Shotgun (`250`)
+  - AssaultRifle (`800`)
+  - RPG (`2000`)
 - `ShopWheelLayout.build_entries(...)` converts catalog items into render-ready `ShopWheelEntry` objects with:
   - radial slot position (`angle_degrees`, `anchor_x`, `anchor_y`)
   - ownership state (`is_owned`)

 ## Core Concepts
 - `ShopCatalogItem` defines a weapon listing with `weapon_name`, `price`, and a weapon factory.
 - `default_shop_catalog()` provides progression store inventory:
-  - Shotgun (`300`)
-  - AssaultRifle (`900`)
-  - RPG (`2500`)
+  - Shotgun (`250`)
+  - AssaultRifle (`800`)
+  - RPG (`2000`)
 - `ShopWheelLayout.build_entries(...)` converts catalog items into render-ready `ShopWheelEntry` objects with:
   - radial slot position (`angle_degrees`, `anchor_x`, `anchor_y`)
   - ownership state (`is_owned`)

# HUD Developer Guide

## Purpose
`src/hud/` contains engine-agnostic HUD state generation and short-lived feedback systems.

## Files
- `overlay.py`: HUD domain models and `HudOverlayController` for health/ammo/money/crosshair rendering payloads, damage flash timing, and kill notifications/counter.
- `__init__.py`: package exports for HUD state/controller types.

## Core Behaviors
- `HudOverlayController.build_state(player)` returns one render-ready payload with:
  - health bar data (`current_health`, `max_health`, `fill_ratio`, severity color)
  - ammo data (`weapon_name`, `in_magazine`, `magazine_size`, `reserve_ammo`, formatted text)
  - money display text
  - center-screen crosshair style and placement
  - damage indicator visibility/intensity/alpha countdown values
  - kill counter and active kill notifications
- `register_damage(amount)` triggers or refreshes the damage indicator flash.
- `register_kill(enemy_label)` increments kill count and adds a short-lived kill notification.
- `step(delta_time)` advances timers and expires transient damage/notification effects.

## Integration Notes
- Keep this module rendering-agnostic: platform/UI layers should only consume `HudOverlayState`.
- Call `step(...)` once per frame and `build_state(...)` when preparing HUD draw data.
- Hook `register_damage(...)` to player damage events and `register_kill(...)` to bot death events.

 ## Core Concepts
 - `ShopCatalogItem` defines a weapon listing with `weapon_name`, `price`, and a weapon factory.
 - `default_shop_catalog()` provides progression store inventory:
-  - Shotgun (`300`)
-  - AssaultRifle (`900`)
-  - RPG (`2500`)
+  - Shotgun (`250`)
+  - AssaultRifle (`800`)
+  - RPG (`2000`)
 - `ShopWheelLayout.build_entries(...)` converts catalog items into render-ready `ShopWheelEntry` objects with:
   - radial slot position (`angle_degrees`, `anchor_x`, `anchor_y`)
   - ownership state (`is_owned`)

+# HUD Developer Guide
+
+## Purpose
+`src/hud/` contains engine-agnostic HUD state generation and short-lived feedback systems.
+
+## Files
+- `overlay.py`: HUD domain models and `HudOverlayController` for health/ammo/money/crosshair rendering payloads, damage flash timing, and kill notifications/counter.
+- `__init__.py`: package exports for HUD state/controller types.
+
+## Core Behaviors
+- `HudOverlayController.build_state(player)` returns one render-ready payload with:
+  - health bar data (`current_health`, `max_health`, `fill_ratio`, severity color)
+  - ammo data (`weapon_name`, `in_magazine`, `magazine_size`, `reserve_ammo`, formatted text)
+  - money display text
+  - center-screen crosshair style and placement
+  - damage indicator visibility/intensity/alpha countdown values
+  - kill counter and active kill notifications
+- `register_damage(amount)` triggers or refreshes the damage indicator flash.
+- `register_kill(enemy_label)` increments kill count and adds a short-lived kill notification.
+- `step(delta_time)` advances timers and expires transient damage/notification effects.
+
+## Integration Notes
+- Keep this module rendering-agnostic: platform/UI layers should only consume `HudOverlayState`.
+- Call `step(...)` once per frame and `build_state(...)` when preparing HUD draw data.
+- Hook `register_damage(...)` to player damage events and `register_kill(...)` to bot death events.

 ## Core Concepts
 - `ShopCatalogItem` defines a weapon listing with `weapon_name`, `price`, and a weapon factory.
 - `default_shop_catalog()` provides progression store inventory:
-  - Shotgun (`300`)
-  - AssaultRifle (`900`)
-  - RPG (`2500`)
+  - Shotgun (`250`)
+  - AssaultRifle (`800`)
+  - RPG (`2000`)
 - `ShopWheelLayout.build_entries(...)` converts catalog items into render-ready `ShopWheelEntry` objects with:
   - radial slot position (`angle_degrees`, `anchor_x`, `anchor_y`)
   - ownership state (`is_owned`)

+# HUD Developer Guide
+
+## Purpose
+`src/hud/` contains engine-agnostic HUD state generation and short-lived feedback systems.
+
+## Files
+- `overlay.py`: HUD domain models and `HudOverlayController` for health/ammo/money/crosshair rendering payloads, damage flash timing, and kill notifications/counter.
+- `__init__.py`: package exports for HUD state/controller types.
+
+## Core Behaviors
+- `HudOverlayController.build_state(player)` returns one render-ready payload with:
+  - health bar data (`current_health`, `max_health`, `fill_ratio`, severity color)
+  - ammo data (`weapon_name`, `in_magazine`, `magazine_size`, `reserve_ammo`, formatted text)
+  - money display text
+  - center-screen crosshair style and placement
+  - damage indicator visibility/intensity/alpha countdown values
+  - kill counter and active kill notifications
+- `register_damage(amount)` triggers or refreshes the damage indicator flash.
+- `register_kill(enemy_label)` increments kill count and adds a short-lived kill notification.
+- `step(delta_time)` advances timers and expires transient damage/notification effects.
+
+## Integration Notes
+- Keep this module rendering-agnostic: platform/UI layers should only consume `HudOverlayState`.
+- Call `step(...)` once per frame and `build_state(...)` when preparing HUD draw data.
+- Hook `register_damage(...)` to player damage events and `register_kill(...)` to bot death events.

 ## Core Concepts
 - `ShopCatalogItem` defines a weapon listing with `weapon_name`, `price`, and a weapon factory.
 - `default_shop_catalog()` provides progression store inventory:
-  - Shotgun (`300`)
-  - AssaultRifle (`900`)
-  - RPG (`2500`)
+  - Shotgun (`250`)
+  - AssaultRifle (`800`)
+  - RPG (`2000`)
 - `ShopWheelLayout.build_entries(...)` converts catalog items into render-ready `ShopWheelEntry` objects with:
   - radial slot position (`angle_degrees`, `anchor_x`, `anchor_y`)
   - ownership state (`is_owned`)

+# HUD Developer Guide
+
+## Purpose
+`src/hud/` contains engine-agnostic HUD state generation and short-lived feedback systems.
+
+## Files
+- `overlay.py`: HUD domain models and `HudOverlayController` for health/ammo/money/crosshair rendering payloads, damage flash timing, and kill notifications/counter.
+- `__init__.py`: package exports for HUD state/controller types.
+
+## Core Behaviors
+- `HudOverlayController.build_state(player)` returns one render-ready payload with:
+  - health bar data (`current_health`, `max_health`, `fill_ratio`, severity color)
+  - ammo data (`weapon_name`, `in_magazine`, `magazine_size`, `reserve_ammo`, formatted text)
+  - money display text
+  - center-screen crosshair style and placement
+  - damage indicator visibility/intensity/alpha countdown values
+  - kill counter and active kill notifications
+- `register_damage(amount)` triggers or refreshes the damage indicator flash.
+- `register_kill(enemy_label)` increments kill count and adds a short-lived kill notification.
+- `step(delta_time)` advances timers and expires transient damage/notification effects.
+
+## Integration Notes
+- Keep this module rendering-agnostic: platform/UI layers should only consume `HudOverlayState`.
+- Call `step(...)` once per frame and `build_state(...)` when preparing HUD draw data.
+- Hook `register_damage(...)` to player damage events and `register_kill(...)` to bot death events.

 ## Core Concepts
 - `ShopCatalogItem` defines a weapon listing with `weapon_name`, `price`, and a weapon factory.
 - `default_shop_catalog()` provides progression store inventory:
-  - Shotgun (`300`)
-  - AssaultRifle (`900`)
-  - RPG (`2500`)
+  - Shotgun (`250`)
+  - AssaultRifle (`800`)
+  - RPG (`2000`)
 - `ShopWheelLayout.build_entries(...)` converts catalog items into render-ready `ShopWheelEntry` objects with:
   - radial slot position (`angle_degrees`, `anchor_x`, `anchor_y`)
   - ownership state (`is_owned`)

+# HUD Developer Guide
+
+## Purpose
+`src/hud/` contains engine-agnostic HUD state generation and short-lived feedback systems.
+
+## Files
+- `overlay.py`: HUD domain models and `HudOverlayController` for health/ammo/money/crosshair rendering payloads, damage flash timing, and kill notifications/counter.
+- `__init__.py`: package exports for HUD state/controller types.
+
+## Core Behaviors
+- `HudOverlayController.build_state(player)` returns one render-ready payload with:
+  - health bar data (`current_health`, `max_health`, `fill_ratio`, severity color)
+  - ammo data (`weapon_name`, `in_magazine`, `magazine_size`, `reserve_ammo`, formatted text)
+  - money display text
+  - center-screen crosshair style and placement
+  - damage indicator visibility/intensity/alpha countdown values
+  - kill counter and active kill notifications
+- `register_damage(amount)` triggers or refreshes the damage indicator flash.
+- `register_kill(enemy_label)` increments kill count and adds a short-lived kill notification.
+- `step(delta_time)` advances timers and expires transient damage/notification effects.
+
+## Integration Notes
+- Keep this module rendering-agnostic: platform/UI layers should only consume `HudOverlayState`.
+- Call `step(...)` once per frame and `build_state(...)` when preparing HUD draw data.
+- Hook `register_damage(...)` to player damage events and `register_kill(...)` to bot death events.

 ## Core Concepts
 - `ShopCatalogItem` defines a weapon listing with `weapon_name`, `price`, and a weapon factory.
 - `default_shop_catalog()` provides progression store inventory:
-  - Shotgun (`300`)
-  - AssaultRifle (`900`)
-  - RPG (`2500`)
+  - Shotgun (`250`)
+  - AssaultRifle (`800`)
+  - RPG (`2000`)
 - `ShopWheelLayout.build_entries(...)` converts catalog items into render-ready `ShopWheelEntry` objects with:
   - radial slot position (`angle_degrees`, `anchor_x`, `anchor_y`)
   - ownership state (`is_owned`)

+# HUD Developer Guide
+
+## Purpose
+`src/hud/` contains engine-agnostic HUD state generation and short-lived feedback systems.
+
+## Files
+- `overlay.py`: HUD domain models and `HudOverlayController` for health/ammo/money/crosshair rendering payloads, damage flash timing, and kill notifications/counter.
+- `__init__.py`: package exports for HUD state/controller types.
+
+## Core Behaviors
+- `HudOverlayController.build_state(player)` returns one render-ready payload with:
+  - health bar data (`current_health`, `max_health`, `fill_ratio`, severity color)
+  - ammo data (`weapon_name`, `in_magazine`, `magazine_size`, `reserve_ammo`, formatted text)
+  - money display text
+  - center-screen crosshair style and placement
+  - damage indicator visibility/intensity/alpha countdown values
+  - kill counter and active kill notifications
+- `register_damage(amount)` triggers or refreshes the damage indicator flash.
+- `register_kill(enemy_label)` increments kill count and adds a short-lived kill notification.
+- `step(delta_time)` advances timers and expires transient damage/notification effects.
+
+## Integration Notes
+- Keep this module rendering-agnostic: platform/UI layers should only consume `HudOverlayState`.
+- Call `step(...)` once per frame and `build_state(...)` when preparing HUD draw data.
+- Hook `register_damage(...)` to player damage events and `register_kill(...)` to bot death events.

 ## Core Concepts
 - `ShopCatalogItem` defines a weapon listing with `weapon_name`, `price`, and a weapon factory.
 - `default_shop_catalog()` provides progression store inventory:
-  - Shotgun (`300`)
-  - AssaultRifle (`900`)
-  - RPG (`2500`)
+  - Shotgun (`250`)
+  - AssaultRifle (`800`)
+  - RPG (`2000`)
 - `ShopWheelLayout.build_entries(...)` converts catalog items into render-ready `ShopWheelEntry` objects with:
   - radial slot position (`angle_degrees`, `anchor_x`, `anchor_y`)
   - ownership state (`is_owned`)

+# HUD Developer Guide
+
+## Purpose
+`src/hud/` contains engine-agnostic HUD state generation and short-lived feedback systems.
+
+## Files
+- `overlay.py`: HUD domain models and `HudOverlayController` for health/ammo/money/crosshair rendering payloads, damage flash timing, and kill notifications/counter.
+- `__init__.py`: package exports for HUD state/controller types.
+
+## Core Behaviors
+- `HudOverlayController.build_state(player)` returns one render-ready payload with:
+  - health bar data (`current_health`, `max_health`, `fill_ratio`, severity color)
+  - ammo data (`weapon_name`, `in_magazine`, `magazine_size`, `reserve_ammo`, formatted text)
+  - money display text
+  - center-screen crosshair style and placement
+  - damage indicator visibility/intensity/alpha countdown values
+  - kill counter and active kill notifications
+- `register_damage(amount)` triggers or refreshes the damage indicator flash.
+- `register_kill(enemy_label)` increments kill count and adds a short-lived kill notification.
+- `step(delta_time)` advances timers and expires transient damage/notification effects.
+
+## Integration Notes
+- Keep this module rendering-agnostic: platform/UI layers should only consume `HudOverlayState`.
+- Call `step(...)` once per frame and `build_state(...)` when preparing HUD draw data.
+- Hook `register_damage(...)` to player damage events and `register_kill(...)` to bot death events.

 ## Core Concepts
 - `ShopCatalogItem` defines a weapon listing with `weapon_name`, `price`, and a weapon factory.
 - `default_shop_catalog()` provides progression store inventory:
-  - Shotgun (`300`)
-  - AssaultRifle (`900`)
-  - RPG (`2500`)
+  - Shotgun (`250`)
+  - AssaultRifle (`800`)
+  - RPG (`2000`)
 - `ShopWheelLayout.build_entries(...)` converts catalog items into render-ready `ShopWheelEntry` objects with:
   - radial slot position (`angle_degrees`, `anchor_x`, `anchor_y`)
   - ownership state (`is_owned`)

+# HUD Developer Guide
+
+## Purpose
+`src/hud/` contains engine-agnostic HUD state generation and short-lived feedback systems.
+
+## Files
+- `overlay.py`: HUD domain models and `HudOverlayController` for health/ammo/money/crosshair rendering payloads, damage flash timing, and kill notifications/counter.
+- `__init__.py`: package exports for HUD state/controller types.
+
+## Core Behaviors
+- `HudOverlayController.build_state(player)` returns one render-ready payload with:
+  - health bar data (`current_health`, `max_health`, `fill_ratio`, severity color)
+  - ammo data (`weapon_name`, `in_magazine`, `magazine_size`, `reserve_ammo`, formatted text)
+  - money display text
+  - center-screen crosshair style and placement
+  - damage indicator visibility/intensity/alpha countdown values
+  - kill counter and active kill notifications
+- `register_damage(amount)` triggers or refreshes the damage indicator flash.
+- `register_kill(enemy_label)` increments kill count and adds a short-lived kill notification.
+- `step(delta_time)` advances timers and expires transient damage/notification effects.
+
+## Integration Notes
+- Keep this module rendering-agnostic: platform/UI layers should only consume `HudOverlayState`.
+- Call `step(...)` once per frame and `build_state(...)` when preparing HUD draw data.
+- Hook `register_damage(...)` to player damage events and `register_kill(...)` to bot death events.

 ## Core Concepts
 - `ShopCatalogItem` defines a weapon listing with `weapon_name`, `price`, and a weapon factory.
 - `default_shop_catalog()` provides progression store inventory:
-  - Shotgun (`300`)
-  - AssaultRifle (`900`)
-  - RPG (`2500`)
+  - Shotgun (`250`)
+  - AssaultRifle (`800`)
+  - RPG (`2000`)
 - `ShopWheelLayout.build_entries(...)` converts catalog items into render-ready `ShopWheelEntry` objects with:
   - radial slot position (`angle_degrees`, `anchor_x`, `anchor_y`)
   - ownership state (`is_owned`)

# Developer Guide

## Project Architecture
This project uses **Python + Ursina** for a lightweight FPS prototype.

The current codebase implements engine-agnostic gameplay foundations in pure Python:
- Core runtime loop and timing
- State machine for high-level game flow
- Clock pause/resume and time scaling controls
- Input normalization for WASD + mouse look
- First-person camera and movement/collision simulation
- Raycasting-based hit-scan traces
- Player model with health, money, inventory, immediate/smooth weapon switching, reload, projectile fire, hit-scan fire, and respawn/game-over
- Weapon system with pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, RPG, switch transitions, and primitive visual recipes
- Projectile entities and physics for bullets, pellets, and rockets
- Shop wheel UI logic with radial layout, weapon prices, affordability feedback, purchase validation, and inventory equip flow
- Multi-room facility model with doorway connectivity, cover placements, lighting profile, and nav waypoints
- Collision world generation from environment rooms/doorways/cover for movement and projectile systems
- Bot runtime model with stateful health/death handling, shot variance, tactical action selection, cover/flank planning, and wave spawning
- Money drop economy with collectible pickups, collision-based collection, and primitive visual definitions

+# HUD Developer Guide
+
+## Purpose
+`src/hud/` contains engine-agnostic HUD state generation and short-lived feedback systems.
+
+## Files
+- `overlay.py`: HUD domain models and `HudOverlayController` for health/ammo/money/crosshair rendering payloads, damage flash timing, and kill notifications/counter.
+- `__init__.py`: package exports for HUD state/controller types.
+
+## Core Behaviors
+- `HudOverlayController.build_state(player)` returns one render-ready payload with:
+  - health bar data (`current_health`, `max_health`, `fill_ratio`, severity color)
+  - ammo data (`weapon_name`, `in_magazine`, `magazine_size`, `reserve_ammo`, formatted text)
+  - money display text
+  - center-screen crosshair style and placement
+  - damage indicator visibility/intensity/alpha countdown values
+  - kill counter and active kill notifications
+- `register_damage(amount)` triggers or refreshes the damage indicator flash.
+- `register_kill(enemy_label)` increments kill count and adds a short-lived kill notification.
+- `step(delta_time)` advances timers and expires transient damage/notification effects.
+
+## Integration Notes
+- Keep this module rendering-agnostic: platform/UI layers should only consume `HudOverlayState`.
+- Call `step(...)` once per frame and `build_state(...)` when preparing HUD draw data.
+- Hook `register_damage(...)` to player damage events and `register_kill(...)` to bot death events.

 ## Core Concepts
 - `ShopCatalogItem` defines a weapon listing with `weapon_name`, `price`, and a weapon factory.
 - `default_shop_catalog()` provides progression store inventory:
-  - Shotgun (`300`)
-  - AssaultRifle (`900`)
-  - RPG (`2500`)
+  - Shotgun (`250`)
+  - AssaultRifle (`800`)
+  - RPG (`2000`)
 - `ShopWheelLayout.build_entries(...)` converts catalog items into render-ready `ShopWheelEntry` objects with:
   - radial slot position (`angle_degrees`, `anchor_x`, `anchor_y`)
   - ownership state (`is_owned`)

+# HUD Developer Guide
+
+## Purpose
+`src/hud/` contains engine-agnostic HUD state generation and short-lived feedback systems.
+
+## Files
+- `overlay.py`: HUD domain models and `HudOverlayController` for health/ammo/money/crosshair rendering payloads, damage flash timing, and kill notifications/counter.
+- `__init__.py`: package exports for HUD state/controller types.
+
+## Core Behaviors
+- `HudOverlayController.build_state(player)` returns one render-ready payload with:
+  - health bar data (`current_health`, `max_health`, `fill_ratio`, severity color)
+  - ammo data (`weapon_name`, `in_magazine`, `magazine_size`, `reserve_ammo`, formatted text)
+  - money display text
+  - center-screen crosshair style and placement
+  - damage indicator visibility/intensity/alpha countdown values
+  - kill counter and active kill notifications
+- `register_damage(amount)` triggers or refreshes the damage indicator flash.
+- `register_kill(enemy_label)` increments kill count and adds a short-lived kill notification.
+- `step(delta_time)` advances timers and expires transient damage/notification effects.
+
+## Integration Notes
+- Keep this module rendering-agnostic: platform/UI layers should only consume `HudOverlayState`.
+- Call `step(...)` once per frame and `build_state(...)` when preparing HUD draw data.
+- Hook `register_damage(...)` to player damage events and `register_kill(...)` to bot death events.

 ## Core Concepts
 - `ShopCatalogItem` defines a weapon listing with `weapon_name`, `price`, and a weapon factory.
 - `default_shop_catalog()` provides progression store inventory:
-  - Shotgun (`300`)
-  - AssaultRifle (`900`)
-  - RPG (`2500`)
+  - Shotgun (`250`)
+  - AssaultRifle (`800`)
+  - RPG (`2000`)
 - `ShopWheelLayout.build_entries(...)` converts catalog items into render-ready `ShopWheelEntry` objects with:
   - radial slot position (`angle_degrees`, `anchor_x`, `anchor_y`)
   - ownership state (`is_owned`)

+# HUD Developer Guide
+
+## Purpose
+`src/hud/` contains engine-agnostic HUD state generation and short-lived feedback systems.
+
+## Files
+- `overlay.py`: HUD domain models and `HudOverlayController` for health/ammo/money/crosshair rendering payloads, damage flash timing, and kill notifications/counter.
+- `__init__.py`: package exports for HUD state/controller types.
+
+## Core Behaviors
+- `HudOverlayController.build_state(player)` returns one render-ready payload with:
+  - health bar data (`current_health`, `max_health`, `fill_ratio`, severity color)
+  - ammo data (`weapon_name`, `in_magazine`, `magazine_size`, `reserve_ammo`, formatted text)
+  - money display text
+  - center-screen crosshair style and placement
+  - damage indicator visibility/intensity/alpha countdown values
+  - kill counter and active kill notifications
+- `register_damage(amount)` triggers or refreshes the damage indicator flash.
+- `register_kill(enemy_label)` increments kill count and adds a short-lived kill notification.
+- `step(delta_time)` advances timers and expires transient damage/notification effects.
+
+## Integration Notes
+- Keep this module rendering-agnostic: platform/UI layers should only consume `HudOverlayState`.
+- Call `step(...)` once per frame and `build_state(...)` when preparing HUD draw data.
+- Hook `register_damage(...)` to player damage events and `register_kill(...)` to bot death events.

 ## Core Concepts
 - `ShopCatalogItem` defines a weapon listing with `weapon_name`, `price`, and a weapon factory.
 - `default_shop_catalog()` provides progression store inventory:
-  - Shotgun (`300`)
-  - AssaultRifle (`900`)
-  - RPG (`2500`)
+  - Shotgun (`250`)
+  - AssaultRifle (`800`)
+  - RPG (`2000`)
 - `ShopWheelLayout.build_entries(...)` converts catalog items into render-ready `ShopWheelEntry` objects with:
   - radial slot position (`angle_degrees`, `anchor_x`, `anchor_y`)
   - ownership state (`is_owned`)

+# HUD Developer Guide
+
+## Purpose
+`src/hud/` contains engine-agnostic HUD state generation and short-lived feedback systems.
+
+## Files
+- `overlay.py`: HUD domain models and `HudOverlayController` for health/ammo/money/crosshair rendering payloads, damage flash timing, and kill notifications/counter.
+- `__init__.py`: package exports for HUD state/controller types.
+
+## Core Behaviors
+- `HudOverlayController.build_state(player)` returns one render-ready payload with:
+  - health bar data (`current_health`, `max_health`, `fill_ratio`, severity color)
+  - ammo data (`weapon_name`, `in_magazine`, `magazine_size`, `reserve_ammo`, formatted text)
+  - money display text
+  - center-screen crosshair style and placement
+  - damage indicator visibility/intensity/alpha countdown values
+  - kill counter and active kill notifications
+- `register_damage(amount)` triggers or refreshes the damage indicator flash.
+- `register_kill(enemy_label)` increments kill count and adds a short-lived kill notification.
+- `step(delta_time)` advances timers and expires transient damage/notification effects.
+
+## Integration Notes
+- Keep this module rendering-agnostic: platform/UI layers should only consume `HudOverlayState`.
+- Call `step(...)` once per frame and `build_state(...)` when preparing HUD draw data.
+- Hook `register_damage(...)` to player damage events and `register_kill(...)` to bot death events.

 ## Core Concepts
 - `ShopCatalogItem` defines a weapon listing with `weapon_name`, `price`, and a weapon factory.
 - `default_shop_catalog()` provides progression store inventory:
-  - Shotgun (`300`)
-  - AssaultRifle (`900`)
-  - RPG (`2500`)
+  - Shotgun (`250`)
+  - AssaultRifle (`800`)
+  - RPG (`2000`)
 - `ShopWheelLayout.build_entries(...)` converts catalog items into render-ready `ShopWheelEntry` objects with:
   - radial slot position (`angle_degrees`, `anchor_x`, `anchor_y`)
   - ownership state (`is_owned`)

+# HUD Developer Guide
+
+## Purpose
+`src/hud/` contains engine-agnostic HUD state generation and short-lived feedback systems.
+
+## Files
+- `overlay.py`: HUD domain models and `HudOverlayController` for health/ammo/money/crosshair rendering payloads, damage flash timing, and kill notifications/counter.
+- `__init__.py`: package exports for HUD state/controller types.
+
+## Core Behaviors
+- `HudOverlayController.build_state(player)` returns one render-ready payload with:
+  - health bar data (`current_health`, `max_health`, `fill_ratio`, severity color)
+  - ammo data (`weapon_name`, `in_magazine`, `magazine_size`, `reserve_ammo`, formatted text)
+  - money display text
+  - center-screen crosshair style and placement
+  - damage indicator visibility/intensity/alpha countdown values
+  - kill counter and active kill notifications
+- `register_damage(amount)` triggers or refreshes the damage indicator flash.
+- `register_kill(enemy_label)` increments kill count and adds a short-lived kill notification.
+- `step(delta_time)` advances timers and expires transient damage/notification effects.
+
+## Integration Notes
+- Keep this module rendering-agnostic: platform/UI layers should only consume `HudOverlayState`.
+- Call `step(...)` once per frame and `build_state(...)` when preparing HUD draw data.
+- Hook `register_damage(...)` to player damage events and `register_kill(...)` to bot death events.

 - `ShopCatalogItem` defines a weapon listing with `weapon_name`, `price`, and a weapon factory.
 - `default_shop_catalog()` provides progression store inventory:
-  - Shotgun (`300`)
-  - AssaultRifle (`900`)
-  - RPG (`2500`)
+  - Shotgun (`250`)
+  - AssaultRifle (`800`)
+  - RPG (`2000`)
 - `ShopWheelLayout.build_entries(...)` converts catalog items into render-ready `ShopWheelEntry` objects with:
   - radial slot position (`angle_degrees`, `anchor_x`, `anchor_y`)
   - ownership state (`is_owned`)

+# HUD Developer Guide
+
+## Purpose
+`src/hud/` contains engine-agnostic HUD state generation and short-lived feedback systems.
+
+## Files
+- `overlay.py`: HUD domain models and `HudOverlayController` for health/ammo/money/crosshair rendering payloads, damage flash timing, and kill notifications/counter.
+- `__init__.py`: package exports for HUD state/controller types.
+
+## Core Behaviors
+- `HudOverlayController.build_state(player)` returns one render-ready payload with:
+  - health bar data (`current_health`, `max_health`, `fill_ratio`, severity color)
+  - ammo data (`weapon_name`, `in_magazine`, `magazine_size`, `reserve_ammo`, formatted text)
+  - money display text
+  - center-screen crosshair style and placement
+  - damage indicator visibility/intensity/alpha countdown values
+  - kill counter and active kill notifications
+- `register_damage(amount)` triggers or refreshes the damage indicator flash.
+- `register_kill(enemy_label)` increments kill count and adds a short-lived kill notification.
+- `step(delta_time)` advances timers and expires transient damage/notification effects.
+
+## Integration Notes
+- Keep this module rendering-agnostic: platform/UI layers should only consume `HudOverlayState`.
+- Call `step(...)` once per frame and `build_state(...)` when preparing HUD draw data.
+- Hook `register_damage(...)` to player damage events and `register_kill(...)` to bot death events.

+# HUD Developer Guide
+
+## Purpose
+`src/hud/` contains engine-agnostic HUD state generation and short-lived feedback systems.
+
+## Files
+- `overlay.py`: HUD domain models and `HudOverlayController` for health/ammo/money/crosshair rendering payloads, damage flash timing, and kill notifications/counter.
+- `__init__.py`: package exports for HUD state/controller types.
+
+## Core Behaviors
+- `HudOverlayController.build_state(player)` returns one render-ready payload with:
+  - health bar data (`current_health`, `max_health`, `fill_ratio`, severity color)
+  - ammo data (`weapon_name`, `in_magazine`, `magazine_size`, `reserve_ammo`, formatted text)
+  - money display text
+  - center-screen crosshair style and placement
+  - damage indicator visibility/intensity/alpha countdown values
+  - kill counter and active kill notifications
+- `register_damage(amount)` triggers or refreshes the damage indicator flash.
+- `register_kill(enemy_label)` increments kill count and adds a short-lived kill notification.
+- `step(delta_time)` advances timers and expires transient damage/notification effects.
+
+## Integration Notes
+- Keep this module rendering-agnostic: platform/UI layers should only consume `HudOverlayState`.
+- Call `step(...)` once per frame and `build_state(...)` when preparing HUD draw data.
+- Hook `register_damage(...)` to player damage events and `register_kill(...)` to bot death events.

 ## Core Concepts
 - `ShopCatalogItem` defines a weapon listing with `weapon_name`, `price`, and a weapon factory.
 - `default_shop_catalog()` provides progression store inventory:
-  - Shotgun (`300`)
-  - AssaultRifle (`900`)
-  - RPG (`2500`)
+  - Shotgun (`250`)
+  - AssaultRifle (`800`)
+  - RPG (`2000`)
 - `ShopWheelLayout.build_entries(...)` converts catalog items into render-ready `ShopWheelEntry` objects with:
   - radial slot position (`angle_degrees`, `anchor_x`, `anchor_y`)
   - ownership state (`is_owned`)

+  - health bar data (`current_health`, `max_health`, `fill_ratio`, severity color)
+  - ammo data (`weapon_name`, `in_magazine`, `magazine_size`, `reserve_ammo`, formatted text)
+  - money display text
+  - center-screen crosshair style and placement
+  - damage indicator visibility/intensity/alpha countdown values
+  - kill counter and active kill notifications
+- `register_damage(amount)` triggers or refreshes the damage indicator flash.
+- `register_kill(enemy_label)` increments kill count and adds a short-lived kill notification.
+- `step(delta_time)` advances timers and expires transient damage/notification effects.
+
+## Integration Notes
+- Keep this module rendering-agnostic: platform/UI layers should only consume `HudOverlayState`.
+- Call `step(...)` once per frame and `build_state(...)` when preparing HUD draw data.
+- Hook `register_damage(...)` to player damage events and `register_kill(...)` to bot death events.

 ## Core Concepts
 - `ShopCatalogItem` defines a weapon listing with `weapon_name`, `price`, and a weapon factory.
 - `default_shop_catalog()` provides progression store inventory:
-  - Shotgun (`300`)
-  - AssaultRifle (`900`)
-  - RPG (`2500`)
+  - Shotgun (`250`)
+  - AssaultRifle (`800`)
+  - RPG (`2000`)
 - `ShopWheelLayout.build_entries(...)` converts catalog items into render-ready `ShopWheelEntry` objects with:
   - radial slot position (`angle_degrees`, `anchor_x`, `anchor_y`)
   - ownership state (`is_owned`)

+# HUD Developer Guide
+
+## Purpose
+`src/hud/` contains engine-agnostic HUD state generation and short-lived feedback systems.
+
+## Files
+- `overlay.py`: HUD domain models and `HudOverlayController` for health/ammo/money/crosshair rendering payloads, damage flash timing, and kill notifications/counter.
+- `__init__.py`: package exports for HUD state/controller types.
+
+## Core Behaviors
+- `HudOverlayController.build_state(player)` returns one render-ready payload with:
+  - health bar data (`current_health`, `max_health`, `fill_ratio`, severity color)
+  - ammo data (`weapon_name`, `in_magazine`, `magazine_size`, `reserve_ammo`, formatted text)
+  - money display text
+  - center-screen crosshair style and placement
+  - damage indicator visibility/intensity/alpha countdown values
+  - kill counter and active kill notifications
+- `register_damage(amount)` triggers or refreshes the damage indicator flash.
+- `register_kill(enemy_label)` increments kill count and adds a short-lived kill notification.
+- `step(delta_time)` advances timers and expires transient damage/notification effects.
+
+## Integration Notes
+- Keep this module rendering-agnostic: platform/UI layers should only consume `HudOverlayState`.
+- Call `step(...)` once per frame and `build_state(...)` when preparing HUD draw data.
+- Hook `register_damage(...)` to player damage events and `register_kill(...)` to bot death events.

 - `ShopCatalogItem` defines a weapon listing with `weapon_name`, `price`, and a weapon factory.
 - `default_shop_catalog()` provides progression store inventory:
-  - Shotgun (`300`)
-  - AssaultRifle (`900`)
-  - RPG (`2500`)
+  - Shotgun (`250`)
+  - AssaultRifle (`800`)
+  - RPG (`2000`)
 - `ShopWheelLayout.build_entries(...)` converts catalog items into render-ready `ShopWheelEntry` objects with:
   - radial slot position (`angle_degrees`, `anchor_x`, `anchor_y`)
   - ownership state (`is_owned`)

+# HUD Developer Guide
+
+## Purpose
+`src/hud/` contains engine-agnostic HUD state generation and short-lived feedback systems.
+
+## Files
+- `overlay.py`: HUD domain models and `HudOverlayController` for health/ammo/money/crosshair rendering payloads, damage flash timing, and kill notifications/counter.
+- `__init__.py`: package exports for HUD state/controller types.
+
+## Core Behaviors
+- `HudOverlayController.build_state(player)` returns one render-ready payload with:
+  - health bar data (`current_health`, `max_health`, `fill_ratio`, severity color)
+  - ammo data (`weapon_name`, `in_magazine`, `magazine_size`, `reserve_ammo`, formatted text)
+  - money display text
+  - center-screen crosshair style and placement
+  - damage indicator visibility/intensity/alpha countdown values
+  - kill counter and active kill notifications
+- `register_damage(amount)` triggers or refreshes the damage indicator flash.
+- `register_kill(enemy_label)` increments kill count and adds a short-lived kill notification.
+- `step(delta_time)` advances timers and expires transient damage/notification effects.
+
+## Integration Notes
+- Keep this module rendering-agnostic: platform/UI layers should only consume `HudOverlayState`.
+- Call `step(...)` once per frame and `build_state(...)` when preparing HUD draw data.
+- Hook `register_damage(...)` to player damage events and `register_kill(...)` to bot death events.

 - `default_shop_catalog()` provides progression store inventory:
-  - Shotgun (`300`)
-  - AssaultRifle (`900`)
-  - RPG (`2500`)
+  - Shotgun (`250`)
+  - AssaultRifle (`800`)
+  - RPG (`2000`)
 - `ShopWheelLayout.build_entries(...)` converts catalog items into render-ready `ShopWheelEntry` objects with:
   - radial slot position (`angle_degrees`, `anchor_x`, `anchor_y`)
   - ownership state (`is_owned`)

+# HUD Developer Guide
+
+## Purpose
+`src/hud/` contains engine-agnostic HUD state generation and short-lived feedback systems.
+
+## Files
+- `overlay.py`: HUD domain models and `HudOverlayController` for health/ammo/money/crosshair rendering payloads, damage flash timing, and kill notifications/counter.
+- `__init__.py`: package exports for HUD state/controller types.
+
+## Core Behaviors
+- `HudOverlayController.build_state(player)` returns one render-ready payload with:
+  - health bar data (`current_health`, `max_health`, `fill_ratio`, severity color)
+  - ammo data (`weapon_name`, `in_magazine`, `magazine_size`, `reserve_ammo`, formatted text)
+  - money display text
+  - center-screen crosshair style and placement
+  - damage indicator visibility/intensity/alpha countdown values
+  - kill counter and active kill notifications
+- `register_damage(amount)` triggers or refreshes the damage indicator flash.
+- `register_kill(enemy_label)` increments kill count and adds a short-lived kill notification.
+- `step(delta_time)` advances timers and expires transient damage/notification effects.
+
+## Integration Notes
+- Keep this module rendering-agnostic: platform/UI layers should only consume `HudOverlayState`.
+- Call `step(...)` once per frame and `build_state(...)` when preparing HUD draw data.
+- Hook `register_damage(...)` to player damage events and `register_kill(...)` to bot death events.

 ## Core Concepts
 - `ShopCatalogItem` defines a weapon listing with `weapon_name`, `price`, and a weapon factory.
 - `default_shop_catalog()` provides progression store inventory:
-  - Shotgun (`300`)
-  - AssaultRifle (`900`)
-  - RPG (`2500`)
+  - Shotgun (`250`)
+  - AssaultRifle (`800`)
+  - RPG (`2000`)
 - `ShopWheelLayout.build_entries(...)` converts catalog items into render-ready `ShopWheelEntry` objects with:
   - radial slot position (`angle_degrees`, `anchor_x`, `anchor_y`)
   - ownership state (`is_owned`)

+# HUD Developer Guide
+
+## Purpose
+`src/hud/` contains engine-agnostic HUD state generation and short-lived feedback systems.
+
+## Files
+- `overlay.py`: HUD domain models and `HudOverlayController` for health/ammo/money/crosshair rendering payloads, damage flash timing, and kill notifications/counter.
+- `__init__.py`: package exports for HUD state/controller types.
+
+## Core Behaviors
+- `HudOverlayController.build_state(player)` returns one render-ready payload with:
+  - health bar data (`current_health`, `max_health`, `fill_ratio`, severity color)
+  - ammo data (`weapon_name`, `in_magazine`, `magazine_size`, `reserve_ammo`, formatted text)
+  - money display text
+  - center-screen crosshair style and placement
+  - damage indicator visibility/intensity/alpha countdown values
+  - kill counter and active kill notifications
+- `register_damage(amount)` triggers or refreshes the damage indicator flash.
+- `register_kill(enemy_label)` increments kill count and adds a short-lived kill notification.
+- `step(delta_time)` advances timers and expires transient damage/notification effects.
+
+## Integration Notes
+- Keep this module rendering-agnostic: platform/UI layers should only consume `HudOverlayState`.
+- Call `step(...)` once per frame and `build_state(...)` when preparing HUD draw data.
+- Hook `register_damage(...)` to player damage events and `register_kill(...)` to bot death events.

 ## Core Concepts
 - `ShopCatalogItem` defines a weapon listing with `weapon_name`, `price`, and a weapon factory.
 - `default_shop_catalog()` provides progression store inventory:
-  - Shotgun (`300`)
-  - AssaultRifle (`900`)
-  - RPG (`2500`)
+  - Shotgun (`250`)
+  - AssaultRifle (`800`)
+  - RPG (`2000`)
 - `ShopWheelLayout.build_entries(...)` converts catalog items into render-ready `ShopWheelEntry` objects with:
   - radial slot position (`angle_degrees`, `anchor_x`, `anchor_y`)
   - ownership state (`is_owned`)

**Preparing concise outcome summary**
codex
Implemented 9 incomplete tasks from `tasks.md`, updated docs, and verified with tests.

Completed tasks marked `[x]` in `tasks.md`:
1. Balance weapon prices according to progression curve
2. Create HUD overlay rendering system
3. Implement health bar display with visual updates
4. Create ammo counter display showing current/max ammo
5. Implement money balance display
6. Add crosshair in center of screen
7. Create damage indicator visual feedback
8. Add kill notification or counter display
9. Create `src/hud` folder `developer-guide.md`

What changed:
- Added HUD system:
  - `src/hud/overlay.py`
  - `src/hud/__init__.py`
  - `src/hud/developer-guide.md`
- Added HUD tests:
  - `tests/test_hud.py`
- Rebalanced economy pricing:
  - `config/config.py` (`Shotgun=250`, `AssaultRifle=800`, `RPG=2000`)
- Updated affected tests/docs:
  - `tests/test_shop_ui.py`
  - `tests/test_config.py`
  - `src/ui/developer-guide.md`
  - `src/developer-guide.md`
  - `config/developer-guide.md`
  - `tests/developer-guide.md`
  - `developer-guide.md`
- Updated tracking files:
  - `tasks.md` (checked off completed tasks, plus added one new follow-up task without executing it)
  - `recent-changes.md`

Validation:
- Ran `pytest -q`
- Result: `45 passed`

+# HUD Developer Guide
+
+## Purpose
+`src/hud/` contains engine-agnostic HUD state generation and short-lived feedback systems.
+
+## Files
+- `overlay.py`: HUD domain models and `HudOverlayController` for health/ammo/money/crosshair rendering payloads, damage flash timing, and kill notifications/counter.
+- `__init__.py`: package exports for HUD state/controller types.
+
+## Core Behaviors
+- `HudOverlayController.build_state(player)` returns one render-ready payload with:
+  - health bar data (`current_health`, `max_health`, `fill_ratio`, severity color)
+  - ammo data (`weapon_name`, `in_magazine`, `magazine_size`, `reserve_ammo`, formatted text)
+  - money display text
+  - center-screen crosshair style and placement
+  - damage indicator visibility/intensity/alpha countdown values
+  - kill counter and active kill notifications
+- `register_damage(amount)` triggers or refreshes the damage indicator flash.
+- `register_kill(enemy_label)` increments kill count and adds a short-lived kill notification.
+- `step(delta_time)` advances timers and expires transient damage/notification effects.
+
+## Integration Notes
+- Keep this module rendering-agnostic: platform/UI layers should only consume `HudOverlayState`.
+- Call `step(...)` once per frame and `build_state(...)` when preparing HUD draw data.
+- Hook `register_damage(...)` to player damage events and `register_kill(...)` to bot death events.

 - `ShopCatalogItem` defines a weapon listing with `weapon_name`, `price`, and a weapon factory.
 - `default_shop_catalog()` provides progression store inventory:
-  - Shotgun (`300`)
-  - AssaultRifle (`900`)
-  - RPG (`2500`)
+  - Shotgun (`250`)
+  - AssaultRifle (`800`)
+  - RPG (`2000`)
 - `ShopWheelLayout.build_entries(...)` converts catalog items into render-ready `ShopWheelEntry` objects with:
   - radial slot position (`angle_degrees`, `anchor_x`, `anchor_y`)
   - ownership state (`is_owned`)
