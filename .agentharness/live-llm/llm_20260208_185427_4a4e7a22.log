**Planning code review process**
codex
I’m going to inspect the repo state exactly as requested, starting with `product-description.md`, then reviewing `git diff`, and finally writing only issue findings into `review/general.md`. I’ll also check and update the relevant developer guides for any folder I edit.

# Review Folder Guide

## Purpose
Stores review output files produced by automated or manual code reviews. Each file is intentionally minimal and may be empty when there are no findings for that category.
Review files should contain only issue lists (no positive notes).

## Files
`architecture.md`
Holds architecture-related findings only.

`documentation.md`
Holds documentation-related findings only.

`efficiency.md`
Holds performance or efficiency-related findings only.

`error_handling.md`
Holds error handling and resilience findings only.

# Product Description: FPS Bot Arena with "The Glitch"

## Overview
A First-Person Shooter (FPS) game where the player fights against waves of tactical AI bots in a multi-room indoor facility. The core loop involves combat, earning money from kills, and upgrading weapons. The game features a meta-twist ending where the final weapon, an RPG, triggers a simulated game crash (Fake BSOD/Error) upon use.

## Gameplay Mechanics
*   **Perspective:** First-Person.
*   **Controls:** Standard FPS controls (WASD + Mouse).
*   **Interaction:** Pressing 'B' opens a real-time inventory/shop wheel to buy and switch weapons.
*   **Win/Loss:**
    *   **Loss:** Player health reaches zero.
    *   **"Win":** Acquiring and firing the final RPG, triggering the "crash" ending.

## Economy & Progression
*   **Income:** Bots drop money as physical items upon death, which the player must collect.
*   **Weapon Progression:**
    1.  **Pistol:** Starting weapon.
    2.  **Shotgun:** High close-range damage.
    3.  **Assault Rifle:** Rapid fire, medium range.
    4.  **RPG (Final Weapon):** Expensive endgame item. Firing it causes a fake "Blue Screen of Death" or critical error message, effectively ending the session.

I’ve finished the diff review and did not find a concrete regression issue in the changed code paths. I’m now updating `review/general.md` to be empty per your rule, and then I’ll make a minimal `review/developer-guide.md` refresh to satisfy the folder-update instruction.
