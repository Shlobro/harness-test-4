**Planning developer-guide updates**
codex
I’m going to inspect the repository instructions first, then run `git diff` and review only UI/UX regressions. After that I’ll write only issue findings to `review/ui_ux.md` (or leave it empty if none).

# Review Folder Guide

## Purpose
Stores review output files produced by automated or manual code reviews. Each file is intentionally minimal and may be empty when there are no findings for that category.
Review files should contain only issue lists (no positive notes).

## Files
`architecture.md`
Holds architecture-related findings only.

`documentation.md`
Holds documentation-related findings only.

`efficiency.md`
Holds performance or efficiency-related findings only.

`error_handling.md`
Holds error handling and resilience findings only.

# Developer Guide

## Project Architecture
This project uses **Python + Ursina** for a lightweight FPS prototype.

The current codebase implements engine-agnostic gameplay foundations in pure Python:
- Core runtime loop and timing
- State machine for high-level game flow
- Clock pause/resume and time scaling controls
- Input normalization for WASD + mouse look
- First-person camera and movement/collision simulation
- Raycasting-based hit-scan traces
- Player model with health, money, inventory, immediate/smooth weapon switching, reload, projectile fire, hit-scan fire, and respawn/game-over
- Weapon system with pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, RPG, switch transitions, and primitive visual recipes
- Projectile entities and physics for bullets, pellets, and rockets
- Shop wheel UI logic with radial layout, weapon prices, affordability feedback, purchase validation, and inventory equip flow
- HUD overlay logic for health/ammo/money/crosshair, damage feedback, and kill notifications
- Multi-room facility model with doorway connectivity, cover placements, lighting profile, and nav waypoints
- Collision world generation from environment rooms/doorways/cover for movement and projectile systems
- Bot runtime model with stateful health/death handling, shot variance, tactical action selection, cover/flank planning, and wave spawning

# Product Description: FPS Bot Arena with "The Glitch"

## Overview
A First-Person Shooter (FPS) game where the player fights against waves of tactical AI bots in a multi-room indoor facility. The core loop involves combat, earning money from kills, and upgrading weapons. The game features a meta-twist ending where the final weapon, an RPG, triggers a simulated game crash (Fake BSOD/Error) upon use.

## Gameplay Mechanics
*   **Perspective:** First-Person.
*   **Controls:** Standard FPS controls (WASD + Mouse).
*   **Interaction:** Pressing 'B' opens a real-time inventory/shop wheel to buy and switch weapons.
*   **Win/Loss:**
    *   **Loss:** Player health reaches zero.
    *   **"Win":** Acquiring and firing the final RPG, triggering the "crash" ending.

## Economy & Progression
*   **Income:** Bots drop money as physical items upon death, which the player must collect.
*   **Weapon Progression:**
    1.  **Pistol:** Starting weapon.
    2.  **Shotgun:** High close-range damage.
    3.  **Assault Rifle:** Rapid fire, medium range.
    4.  **RPG (Final Weapon):** Expensive endgame item. Firing it causes a fake "Blue Screen of Death" or critical error message, effectively ending the session.

**Inspecting recent git changes**
codex
I’ve loaded the required guides. Next I’m inspecting `git diff` to identify only UI/UX issues in the recent changes.

**Assessing untracked UI code impact**

I’ve finished scanning the diff; I’m now checking `review/ui_ux.md` state so I can either clear it or write issue-only findings accordingly.
