# Developer Guide

## Project Architecture
This project uses **Python + Ursina** for the fastest path to a lightweight 3D FPS prototype with minimal setup overhead.

## Directory Map
- `src/`: game systems and runtime code.
- `assets/`: static assets (models, audio, textures). Currently placeholder-only.
- `config/`: centralized runtime configuration modules.
- `tests/`: automated test suite.
- `requirements.txt`: pinned Python dependencies.

## Technology Stack Decision
- Language/runtime: Python 3.11+.
- Engine: Ursina (`ursina==6.1.2`).
- Rationale: aligns with quick prototype goals, simple geometric rendering, and first-person mechanics without heavy custom engine work.

## Current Runtime Config
- `config/config.py` exposes `GAME_CONFIG` and `ECONOMY_CONFIG` dataclass instances.
- Game systems should import from `config.config` rather than duplicating constant values.

## Development Notes
- Keep gameplay constants in `config/config.py` until a richer configuration layer is needed.
- Add per-folder `developer-guide.md` files when new code folders gain implementation files.
