# Recent Changes

- Implemented a complete shop wheel UI logic module in `src/ui/shop_wheel.py` with:
  - radial entry layout generation,
  - default weapon catalog and prices,
  - ownership/equipped/affordability entry state,
  - purchase-or-equip flow with money validation,
  - shop open/close control that pauses `GameClock` and transitions `GameStateManager` between `playing` and `paused`.
- Added `src/ui/__init__.py` exports and created `src/ui/developer-guide.md`.
- Extended `src/core/input_handler.py` so `InputFrame` includes `toggle_shop`, triggered on `B` key press edges (not key hold).
- Added `tests/test_shop_ui.py` to verify:
  - radial slot layout and price visibility,
  - `B` toggle behavior,
  - pause/state synchronization while shop is open,
  - affordability and equipped-state feedback,
  - weapon purchasing and inventory selection/equipping.
- Updated documentation guides to reflect current behavior:
  - `developer-guide.md`
  - `src/developer-guide.md`
  - `src/core/developer-guide.md`
  - `tests/developer-guide.md`
